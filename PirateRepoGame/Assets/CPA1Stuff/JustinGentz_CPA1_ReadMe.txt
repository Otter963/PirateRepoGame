Hey Brendan,

So, I've made life a little easy, I've got the three shaders pretty much right in front of you. 

The grass swaying shader, two different colours of the fire smoke fx and the health bar shader effect.
I had been struggling to find good sources for shader graphs in HDRP, so if you have any other resources,
that would be great.

The object pooling has been used with your script, it's a little buggy with the bullets, I would like to know
how I could fix that.
